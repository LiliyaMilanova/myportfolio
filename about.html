                    <h2>Why Designer?</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am Lilia and I got my education at the National Academy of Arts in the subject of Poster and Visual Communication. My interests are art, design and technology.</p>
                    <p>For several years I combined the positions of a website administrator and designer in an online shop moebebe. For me, the job was a challenge that allowed me to develop experience in web design, photography and video processing. I received a valuable experience in communicating with clients and partners, as well as building the face of the brand on social networks. I realized I was very excited, when I have to write html and css code, so I decided to improve my skills with the courses of Software University. Currently my interests are mainly in the UX and UI projects.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to find a position in an organization that will allow me to continue learning and following my passion for design.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for seeing my portfolio.</p>
